## v1 — first live-rendered dataset (2,037 images, 800 scenarios)

**Dataset:** `live_dataset/train2000`. Baseline generator: fixed night preset (no exposure
variety), 20% night share, occlusion filter kept any object ≥10% visible at full un-occluded
box extent, only 7 of 14 vehicle models had paint-color variation (bus/most trucks/some
SUVs fixed to one factory color), object annotation had no distance cutoff (long unobstructed
streets over-represented distant, small objects in the training labels).
