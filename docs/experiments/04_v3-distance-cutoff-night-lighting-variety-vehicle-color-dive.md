## v3 — distance cutoff + night lighting variety + vehicle color diversity (fresh 2,037-image render)

**Dataset:** `live_dataset/train2000_v3`, same 800 scenario seeds as v1/v2 (isolates the
generator changes from city-layout randomness). Three fixes, each independently measured
against real benchmark statistics before implementing:
- **Per-category max annotation distance** (pedestrian 30m, car/SUV 54m, bus 41m, truck 53m),
  fit by matching synthetic median box-height-as-fraction-of-frame to BDD100K/Cityscapes'
  own measured values. Root cause: long, unobstructed streets meant every frame's annotations
  included far more distant, small objects than real dashcam sightlines ever contain.
- **Night exposure variety**: `NIGHT_EXPOSURE_BIAS_RANGE_EV = (-4.34, -0.38)` replacing one
  fixed value, and `night_share` raised from 20% to 39% to match BDD100K's own measured night
  share. Root cause: night brightness std was 1.92 across our old renders vs 15.73 in BDD100K
  (real photos span ~4 stops of brightness; ours spanned under 2).
- **Vehicle paint diversity**: extended the recolor mechanism (project-owned paint material
  copy, `Paint Variation` switch off, runtime `BaseColor` override) from 7 to 12 of 14 models
  — van, all 3 non-recolorable trucks, and the bus. Taxi and police-car liveries deliberately
  excluded (real, baked-in liveries, not arbitrary colors). Root cause: every bus/most trucks
  rendered in one fixed factory color in every scenario, forever.
- Also carried forward the v2 occlusion-visibility refilter (0.5 floor).

Live-verified before the full run: 40-scenario pre-flight batch confirmed box heights matched
distance-cutoff targets, night brightness variance present at the right order of magnitude,
and all 12 recolorable models showing full real-world color-share distributions.

| Arm | BDD100K AP / AP50 | Cityscapes AP / AP50 |
|---|---|---|
| Scratch | 2.7 / 5.7 | 4.3 / 7.2 |
| Fine-tune | 6.1 / 11.8 | 12.9 / 21.1 (bus 3.6→11.2, truck 3.8→6.0) |

**Verdict:** essentially flat on BDD100K (the larger, more reliable benchmark — 10,000 images,
1,597 bus boxes); a real-looking gain on Cityscapes concentrated in bus/truck, but Cityscapes'
bus/truck ground truth is tiny (98/93 boxes total), so that gain isn't fully trusted yet. All
three fixes were independently confirmed working exactly as designed — the lack of BDD100K
improvement means these three factors are not the dominant cause of the sim-to-real gap.

### Post-v3 diagnostic deep-dive (5 parallel research agents, all evidence-based)

1. **Pixel statistics** (300 images/source, measured): synthetic renders are 2.6-3.0x sharper
   (Laplacian variance) and 1.3-1.9x more saturated than both real benchmarks. BDD100K alone
   shows a strong JPEG block-compression signature (~1.86x) our lossless PNGs and Cityscapes
   PNGs both lack (~1.0x, confirming this is JPEG-specific, not a general synthetic-vs-real gap).
2. **Grad-CAM** (21 real images, all 3 detection scales hooked, verified visually): attention
   is diffuse and concentrates on generic high-contrast texture — tree foliage, curb edges,
   lane paint, wet-road glare — rather than vehicle/pedestrian shape. Directly corroborates
   finding 1: the model likely learned "sharp edge = object" from oversharpened, oversaturated
   training renders, a cue any high-contrast real texture also satisfies.

   ![Grad-CAM on a Cityscapes frame: the hottest activations sit in the tree canopy at the top of the frame, not on the DHL truck below it](../images/gradcam_truck_foliage.jpg)
   *The model's top prediction here is "truck" (conf 0.78) on the real DHL truck, but the
   strongest, reddest Grad-CAM activations are in the foliage above it, not the truck itself.*
3. **Label convention** (confirmed via BDD100K's official annotation instructions, direct
   quote): BDD100K boxes only the *visible* portion of an object for both truncation and
   occlusion (modal). Cityscapes' polygon-derived instances work the same way. Our frame-edge
   truncation is already modal-correct (boxes are genuinely clipped to in-frame content), but
   occlusion-by-another-object is not — objects above the 0.5 visibility floor still get the
   full un-occluded extent, not the visible sub-region. Real, confirmed, unaddressed mismatch.
4. **Rendering pipeline audit** (code-cited): motion blur, depth of field, chromatic
   aberration, film grain, vignetting, and lens distortion are all absent from the render
   pipeline; auto-exposure is deliberately tuned for stability, the opposite of real cameras.
   Training augmentation uses ultralytics defaults unmodified, including `mosaic=1.0` on
   single-coherent-scene synthetic data — flagged as a plausible, untested contributor.
5. **Remaining asset diversity** (exact counts, not estimates): pedestrian clothing/face
   variety is already substantial (57 tops, 33 bottoms, 12 faces) — not a bottleneck. Real
   gaps: only 2 pedestrian poses total and zero age diversity (content-limited, not a quick
   fix); every street tree is the same species despite 3 more being fully installed and
   unused; a handful of unused building levels/props (minor).
