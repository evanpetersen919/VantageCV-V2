## v4a — image realism post-process (blur + desaturate + JPEG round-trip)

**Change:** `bin/apply_image_realism.py` reprocessed v3's existing 2,037 images (no
re-render) with parameters chosen by `bin/calibrate_image_realism.py` against the pixel-stat
targets from the post-v3 diagnostic: Gaussian blur sigma 0.4, saturation x0.75, JPEG quality
75, no added noise (noise alone raised sharpness back up in calibration, so excluded).
Annotations/boxes completely unchanged — isolates the pixel-realism hypothesis from the
box-convention one. Calibration itself needed one real bug fix first: it was measuring
Laplacian variance at native render resolution instead of training imgsz (960) — a
scale-dependent metric, so the first calibration pass looked far blurrier than it actually
was at the resolution the network trains on.

| Arm | BDD100K AP / AP50 | Cityscapes AP / AP50 |
|---|---|---|
| Scratch v3 → v4a | 2.7 / 5.7 → 2.8 / 5.8 | 4.3 / 7.2 → 4.2 / 7.5 |
| Fine-tune v3 → v4a | 6.1 / 11.8 → 6.5 / 12.8 (person 6.4→8.5, car 12.7→14.1, **truck 3.5→1.3**) | 12.9 / 21.1 → 11.0 / 18.8 (bus 11.2→7.0, truck 6.0→3.0) |

**Verdict: mixed, not a clear win.** Scratch is flat on both benchmarks (within noise).
Fine-tune shows a small BDD100K gain (+0.4 AP) but a real Cityscapes regression (-1.9 AP),
with truck AP dropping on both benchmarks. This does not confirm the pixel-statistics
hypothesis as the dominant cause — either the effect is real but this specific treatment
(uniform blur across the whole image) also destroyed legitimate fine detail needed for
smaller/more detailed classes like truck, or the single-seed run-to-run noise on Cityscapes'
tiny bus/truck ground truth (98/93 boxes) is large enough to explain most of this swing on
its own. Not pursuing a refined version of this treatment next; proceeding to v4b instead,
which is independent of this result.
